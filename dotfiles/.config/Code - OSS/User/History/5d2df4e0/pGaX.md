# PORTABLE ECG MACHINE

According to current statistics, over 1.6 million people die in India due to a lack of access to
health care. Most of these cases occur in rural areas of the developing nations including India.<br>
Difficulty in accessing immediate health care is important for the proper treatment and recovery
of many diseases.
<br>
Heart diseases come under a category of conditions that need to be detected early for proper
recovery and treatment.

**An Electrocardiogram (ECG)** is a simple test that can be used to detect
the heartâ€™s rhythm and electrical activity, thereby diagnosing conditions that affect the heart.

 <br>
It
can be used to investigate the symptoms of possible heart disease including chest pain,
palpitations, dizziness, shortness of breath, etc... which may point toward any heart condition
including 

<br>

* tachycardia
* bradycardia
* and heart attack.

<br>
There are many high-grade types of equipment in hospitals to carry out ECGs on patients. But in
many cases, the time taken to reach a hospital might be the fate that decides life or death. <br>There
are many places in the world where people are unable to access healthcare services quickly. <br>In
such cases, mainly in rural areas, a portable handheld device to carry out resting ECG can be
useful in detecting a heart condition.
